//! All things RPKI.
//!
//! The _Resource Public Key Infrastructure_ (RPKI) is an application of
//! PKI to Internet routing security. It allows owners of IP address prefixes
//! to publish cryptographically signed associations of their prefixes to
//! autonomous systems, allowing the validation of the origin of a route
//! announcement in BGP.
//!
//! This crate contains types and functionality useful for building RPKI
//! applications.
